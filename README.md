# 30Days30Projects

## What's #30Days30Projects? 
As the name suggests, I'm attempting to build 30 different small projects in 30 days! I'll share my journey on Medium, Twitter, and Dev.to, and this repo serves as a place to find each project's source code.


## Why #30Days30Projects? 
I'd love to use this challenge as a way to: 
- Preview and test out new frameworks and libraries with familiar languages
- Get back into the habit of shipping code each day
- Share with students my love of coding for creativity and fun 

I think that through continuously following the process of coming up with an idea, drafting it out, and creating it from scratch, I can not only educate my students on being process-oriented in their creations, but share tips and tricks I've learned along the way. I hope that through this challenge I am able to motivate others to push themselves to be lifelong learners in whatever they're proficient in! 


## What Languages? 
I am going to build my projects in: 

- Ruby 
- Ruby on Rails
- JS
- HTML/CSS

To directly benefit the students I'm teaching currently at Flatiron School. I hope that this repo inspires you to iterate and add to your own portfolio!
